      is preferable to use school-level variables as student attributes. To do so,

    description: In TIMSS 2023, mathematics and science teachers of sampled students
      were asked to complete a separate questionnaire for each class they taught that
      included sampled students, providing information on their teaching context,
      instructional practices, and attitudes; the resulting teacher background data
      files contain one record for each of these classes.

    description: In TIMSS 2023, mathematics and science teachers of sampled students
      were asked to complete a separate questionnaire for each class they taught that
      included sampled students, providing information on their teaching context,
      instructional practices, and attitudes; the resulting teacher background data
      files contain one record for each of these classes.
