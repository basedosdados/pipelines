    description: This dataset is the Trase beef supply chain (v2.0.1). Trase maps
      supply chains for agricultural commodities, making it possible to link products
      and supply chain actors with specific areas of production, and associated sustainability
      risks and opportunities. For all beef, offal and live cattle exports from 2015-2017,
      this model mapped the likely municipality of origin. It use trade and production
      data, slaughterhouse tax registrations, company assetownership information,
      export licences, a large dataset of cattle movements between farms and from
      farms to slaughterhouses, and government data on the origin of cattle slaughtered
      in exportapproved slaughterhouses.
